# Sustainable-Info-Structure-Project
HTML and CSS project for COM 421

Reflection:
My first objective was to copy and markup each document.  For images, I found the <figure> element which allowed me to easily add a caption.

Next, I added some CSS formatting.  I wanted to change the background color from a bright white to a slightly tinted color to be a little easier on the eyes.  Next, I changed the font to something a little bigger and more readable.  After this, I added more spacing after lists, images, and sidebars to space the document out better.  I couldn't figure out how to add a collapsible sidebar, so I instead highlighted them with a deeper color to make them stand out.

If I had more time to work on this project, I would have tried to add a little JavaScript for popup sidebars.  As for page organization, I would have added dropdown menus and chapters for easier navigation.
